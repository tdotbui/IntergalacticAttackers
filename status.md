Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created the player's spaceship, movement for the spaceship, a laser projectile that shoots from the spaceship, as well as an enemy that moves across the screen.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The menu for the game, original sprites for the spaceship and enemies, collision detection, the ability for multiple enemies to spawn.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of the hardest parts is trying to understand how to implement multiple enemies on the screen that are not overlapping each other and don't cross over each other when moving side to side.
