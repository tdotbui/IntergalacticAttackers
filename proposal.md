# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mobile Suit Fighter I (Name is very much a work in progress.)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a game that is similar to that of Space Invaders.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a game that is coded in Lua. My aim is to make a 2d shooter like Space Invaders that will have features such as procedural generation and multiple levels. It will be executed using Love2D.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Working alone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be a working menu, basic mechanics of the game (i.e the flying of the character and killing enemies), sound, and a HUD.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be all the things included in the good outcome as well as adding procedural generation into the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be all the things included in the better outcome as well as having multiple levels for the game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

    To begin with, I need to complete the Mario assignment for the games track, as that will help greatly with beginning to understand how procedural generation works in games.\n
In addition, I will need to learn how to create basic graphics and images for my game (the background, the character, and the enemies). Some skills that I will need to acquire for\n
this project is a better understand of object oriented programming, as well as learning more about space machines, both of which seem very important for video game development.
