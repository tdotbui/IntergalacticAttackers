## CHALLENGES

Some of the most difficult parts of creating this game was implementing lasers and the aliens.
I had to figure out a way to spawn multiple numbers of these objects without having to code individual objects (i.e. alien1, alien2, alien3, etc.).
To find a solution to this problem I had to learn about tables and how they function within Lua.

## TAKEAWAYS

1. Improved a lot in my understanding of object-oriented programming.
2. Got a lot better at debugging my own code.
